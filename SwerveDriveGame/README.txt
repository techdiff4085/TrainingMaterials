*** How to Run
To run click on the "Pwnage Swerve Game.jar" file
Note: you must have java installed


*** Goal of the Game
The goal is to drive around and collect as many balls as possible using the front end of the swerve drive.
The bigger the ball the more points it is worth.
Note: The green triangle is pointing to the front of the robot. 


*** Methods of Control
There are three methods of control: keyboard, gamepad, and two joysticks.

***** Keyboard
To drive the bot use WASD to translate and the left/right arrows to turn.
The Space key is used to start timing.

***** Gamepad
A gamepad is a input device like an xbox controller.
To drive the bot use the left stick to translate and the right stick X axis to turn.
Button 5 is used to start timing. On an xbox controller this is the A button.

***** Two Joysticks
A joystick is a input device like an attack controller. Two of them are needed to play.
To drive the bot use the left stick to translate and the right stick X axis to turn.
Button 1 on the rotation stick is used to start timing.


*** Drive Modes
There are two drive modes: gyro, and crab.

***** Gyro
This mode is a field-centric drive mode. One stick is used to translate in reference to the screen.
The other stick's x axis is used to rotate. Rotation can be done even while translating.

***** Crab
This mode is a robot-centric drive mode. One stick is used to translate in reference to the robot.
The other stick's x axis is used to rotate. When rotation is applied during translation, an arc turn is performed.



*** Game Modes
There are two game modes: free, and timed.

***** Free
Free mode is used for demostrational purposes. In this mode the robot is able to move even after time runs out.

***** Timed
Timed mode is used for gaming purposes. In this mode the robot will be stopped after time runs out.
